# Hyperion: A High-Performance HTTP/1.1 Server in Java

Hyperion is a lightweight, multi-threaded HTTP/1.1 server implementation written in pure Java with no external dependencies. It features support for persistent connections, content compression, concurrent request handling, and a flexible file-serving system.

## ‚ú® Features

Hyperion implements core HTTP/1.1 functionality:

- **Persistent Connections**: Keep TCP connections alive for multiple requests, improving performance
- **Concurrent Request Handling**: Process multiple client connections simultaneously
- **Content Compression**: Automatically compress responses using gzip when supported by clients
- **File Serving**: Read and write files with proper error handling
- **Content Negotiation**: Honor client preferences for compression via Accept-Encoding
- **Standards Compliant**: Proper HTTP/1.1 status codes, headers, and response formats
- **Zero Dependencies**: Written in pure Java with no external libraries

## üèó Architecture

![Hyperion Architecture](docs/architecture.png)

Hyperion uses a thread-per-connection model with the following components:

1. **Main Server Thread**: Accepts new TCP connections and delegates them to handler threads
2. **Connection Handlers**: Each client connection gets a dedicated thread that processes multiple requests
3. **Request Parser**: Extracts HTTP method, headers, and body
4. **Route Handler**: Maps URL paths to appropriate handlers
5. **Response Formatter**: Constructs HTTP responses with proper headers and compression

The server maintains connection state for persistent connections while isolating each client's data to ensure thread safety.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 11 or higher
- Maven (optional, for building from source)

### Installation

#### Running the pre-built JAR:

```bash
# Run the server on the default port (4221)
java -jar hyperion.jar

# Run with a specific file directory
java -jar hyperion.jar --directory /path/to/files

# Run with custom port (using JVM arguments)
java -Dport=8080 -jar hyperion.jar
```

#### Building from source:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hyperion.git
cd hyperion

# Build the JAR
javac -d build src/main/java/com/hyperion/*.java
jar cvfe hyperion.jar com.hyperion.Main -C build .

# Run the server
java -jar hyperion.jar
```

## üîå API Endpoints

Hyperion supports the following endpoints:

### Root Endpoint
```
GET /
```
Returns a 200 OK response with an empty body.

### Echo Endpoint
```
GET /echo/{string}
```
Returns the {string} value as plain text.

Supports gzip compression when requested via Accept-Encoding header.

### User-Agent Endpoint
```
GET /user-agent
```
Returns the User-Agent header value as plain text.

### Files Endpoint
```
GET /files/{filename}
```
Returns the contents of the specified file from the configured directory.

```
POST /files/{filename}
```
Creates or overwrites a file with the specified name, using the request body as content.

## üîß Implementation Details

### HTTP Protocol Implementation

Hyperion implements core HTTP/1.1 features as defined in [RFC 7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230):

- Request parsing and validation
- Response construction
- Header processing
- Content-Length handling
- Connection persistence

### Thread Management

The server employs a thread-per-connection model where:

- Each TCP connection gets a dedicated Java thread
- Connection state is maintained for the life of the connection
- Thread-local storage prevents cross-connection contamination
- Socket timeouts prevent resource leaks from abandoned connections

### Compression

The gzip compression implementation:

- Uses Java's built-in GZIPOutputStream
- Only activates when clients support it (via Accept-Encoding header)
- Includes proper Content-Encoding headers
- Updates Content-Length to reflect compressed size
- Has fallback mechanisms if compression fails

### File Handling

File operations are implemented using Java NIO for better performance:

- Non-blocking I/O where appropriate
- Memory-mapped files for large file transfers
- Proper exception handling for missing files and permission issues
- Support for binary files with correct Content-Type headers

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

Future versions of Hyperion may include:

- **HTTP/2 Support**: Multiplexing, server push, header compression
- **WebSocket Protocol**: Enable real-time bidirectional communication
- **Thread Pooling**: Replace thread-per-connection with NIO and worker pools
- **TLS/HTTPS Support**: Secure communication
- **Request Routing DSL**: Simplified API for defining routes
- **Middleware Support**: Plugin architecture for request/response processing
- **Static Asset Optimization**: Automatic minification and bundling
- **Enhanced Logging**: Structured logging with different verbosity levels
- **Admin Dashboard**: Runtime metrics and configuration
